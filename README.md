# AssistaBot
## An attempt at a bot by Shadav

lol if my head wasn't already hurting it sure is now...trying to wrap my brain around way too much info but hey we're getting there

essentially for v1 i'm just gonna work on how to get custom commands and yeet nightbot out of the server
then to figure out how to get it to work in twitch so i can yeet nightbot out of there as well

Please remember if you for some random reason decide to use this bot for yourself, I do not entirely know what I am doing, I know just enough to get myself in to trouble, I spent a lot of time looking up tutorials and examples and honestly a lot of help from ai. So things may or may not work, but so far everything seems to be working except for the timed messages in twitch chat.

### TO DO
- completely broke the streaming module, got discord to work but broke everything else...i'll work on rebuilding it later, nut now i know more how to intially set it up...1 presence streaming, 1 api stheaming, ` voicechannel status detection for discord streaming

### IMPROVE ON
- birthday module
- invite module
- logging system

### DONE
- Create a [ChannelLog](https://github.com/leashadav/AssistaBot/blob/main/ChannelLog.md)
- get commands to work in twitch chat
- giveaway module
- stream notifications
- welcome message module
- purge command
- improve the ticket module
- asked ai to sum up the bot functions and permissions lol: [Info](https://github.com/leashadav/AssistaBot/blob/main/info.md)
